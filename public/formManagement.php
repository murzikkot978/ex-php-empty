 * On this page, you should display a form with two fields, one for the Name and one for the Age.
 * The server should respond to the form submission by displaying the same page with the name and age in a h1 "Toto is 20 years old".
 * If there is no submission or only one of the two fields, the h1 should display "Submit the form".
 * If the user have a name with more than 6 characters, the name must be displayed in red (only the name, not all h1).
 * If the user is more than 18 years old, you should display a list with one line per year of the age of the user.
 * The data submitted should remain displayed in the form after the submission.
 * (Your form should be semantically correct, use a label and name your fields)
